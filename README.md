another to deposit the milk and finally one to deposit the spoon, the whole process is automatic and the amount of cereal and milk can be varied according to the needs of the user. 

Dog bot: Implementation of a bio network inspired by a robot with differential dynamics, with the implementation of a gripper and camera vision, 
for the detection, capture and return, in this case of a red ball.
