# Brief summary of each project 

Cereal Os: Machine that makes the cereal, has 3 stages: one stage to deposit the cereal, 
another to deposit the milk and finally one to deposit the spoon, the whole process is automatic and the amount of cereal and milk can be varied according to the needs of the user. 

Dog bot: Implementation of a bio network inspired by a robot with differential dynamics, with the implementation of a gripper and camera vision, 
for the detection, capture and return, in this case of a red ball.

Follow_bot: A low-cost robot designed for target detection and tracking, utilizing a smartphone camera for object recognition. The camera streams video via an IP address, which is then processed by a Python script using YOLOv8 for object detection. The robot's control system is powered by an ESP32, which receives speed commands through the MQTT protocol. It features PID control for precise movement, enabled by photo encoders for feedback.

MLP: Implementation of back propagation with adam optimization for multilayer network training without the use of specialized libraries
